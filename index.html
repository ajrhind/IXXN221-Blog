  <p><h3>18/07 Tutorial</h3><br>Today we started with doing an excercise about user persona. We were given a character(Spongebob) and we had to profile him. This included talking about his personality, his goals, his pain points, and charatcer traits.</p>
<p>I found this to be quite helpful, as it helped to visualize the target audience, and help me to understand them a bit more.</p>

<div class="pic">

</div>

<p>We then made an empathy map for the character, to help understand how they're thinking.</p>
<div class="pic">
<img class="zoom" src="img/empathy-map.jpg" style="height:250px;"> </div>
<p>I felt this part to be less useful, because I feel like we already kind of captured all we needed to with the user persona.</p>

<p>Overall I feel like this task will be very helpful for when I do actually make a website. It helps to make sure that you understand you're audience and their needs. This is arguably the most important part of building a website.
I feel like this will now make me think more when designing for certain types of people.</p>
<p><h3>21/07</h3><br> I have to start think about what kind of website I want to do, and start working on a user persona. I was thinking about doing a cooking tips website, where it covers the basics, gives extra little tips, and some really easy recipes.
  I would imagine that this website would be for people just starting to get into cooking/baking, or people who are just starting out by themselves. I would want it to be as easy as possible to understand and follow.

<p><h3> 25/07 Tutorial </h3><br> Some websites I like the design aesthetic of:
  <ol>
  <li> <a href=https://p5js.org/reference> P5JS reference website</a></li>
  <li><a href=https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html> Wordle</a></li>
  <li><a href=https://www.chelsea.co.nz/> Chelsea Sugar</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Some characters I'm thinking of using:
  <ul>
    <li><a href=https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Alfredo_Linguini> Linguini from <i>Rataouille</i></a></li>
    <li><a href=https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/The_Swedish_Chef> The Swedish Chef from <i>The Muppets</i></a></li>
    <li><a href=https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Link>Link from <i>The Legend Of Zelda</i></a></li>
  </ul>


  <p> Today I mostly spent my time refining this blog HTML. I've been playing around with a nav bar and different colours and stuff. I also chose my character to use! It will be Linguini from Rataouille. I'm going to be making a beginners cooking website for people like him, who need
  to walked through the cooking process very thoroughly.</p>

  <h2> August Work </h2>
<p><h3> 1/08 Tutorial </h3><br> Today we have been making user journey maps, and user flow diagrams. We now have to make a box model and workout measurements, to practice how to do padding and margins etc.
   I'm going to put a centered picture of Linguini in, and have a bunch of padding, and smallish margin, and a small border. <br><br>After multiple attempts
  I have managed to get the image zoom and the border working at the same time!</P>

<div class="picL">
   <img class="zoomL" src="img/Linguini.jpg" style="width:500px;">
   </div>
<p> One of the tutors also told me I should use a flex box instead of a nav bar table, because it will help a lot with formatting later. I also still have to finish
  the venn diagram, and I need to expand on my empathy map and user persona.</p>

<p><h3>8/08 Tutorial</h3><br> I've finally started putting my project together after having it all on paper for so long. I'm currently working on the empathy map, and I've found this part the most difficult so far, but
  I think this is because we kind of have to "know" the character, even though we are making up what they're meant to be thinking or saying. I found that asking other people what they would say or do if they didn't know how to cook
  has helped me a lot.<br> I still have the customer journey map and the user flow to complete, but I didnt find these too difficult when we did them in the tutorial. I'm also going to look at flex boxes today, and then replace the
nav bar table I have. I'm doing this because I was told that it will help with formatting and make it a lot easier in the end.</p>

<p><h3>15/08</h3><br> I've finished all of my diagrams like the User Persona, Empathy map, Venn diagram, User flow, and customer journey map. We all presented our research propoasla today,
  and I think I did okay. I didn't prepare anything anywhere near enough to talk about it, so I foound myself mumbling, stumbling and repeating my words. I do think I would have done a lot better if I had just
  reread what I had written. I got the advice that I should narrow down the target audience, instead of being for anyone starting to cook, I should cut it down to maybe just young adults etc. I alos got told that I should
  think more about the leveling system, like what would happen when the user would gain a level, how many points it takes, etc.<br>
  I think that this advice is really helpful for when I start to actually make the website. I'm definitely going to try and make the website planned out far better than this first project.</p>

  I haven't really been on top of updating this blog, but I haver been making some good progess. I've done all my <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/Xrtv1c6Wuoib84WKPeYws2/Linguini-website-wireframes?node-id=0%3A1">low fi</a> wireframes, and now my
  <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/b6FYonIctSycA1hVxh4Xhj/Hifi-stuff?node-id=0%3A1">hi fi</a> wireframes.
<br> I tried to do the prototyping with the flows and such and figma, but I'm finding it quite difficult. I don't really know how to use figma very well anyway, but I had gotten a small demo from Chloe, but she is much better than I
at it and she knows what shes doing. I still need to do the write up, which I can't imagine will take too long, but I know I need to get it done right.

<h2>October</h2>
<p><h3>2/10</h3><br>
  I keep forgetting to update this, but from when we had to present our wireframes, I got some quite good feedback. I was told that I dont actually need the
  boarders for the pictures, and I should just focus on making it look nice. I also need to adjust the width of the boarders for somethings, to make it overall more cohesive. 
  I also got a comment that in my figma Hi-fi frames that my logo has squared corners, and everything else is rounded, so I need to fix that 
  so it looks better.
<br><br>
  I currently am making the basics for all the pages, and just laying them out to look pretty much the same as the figma Hi-Fi frames,
   and then get into the details like shadows or little scrolling animations. I have sussed my button hovers though, but I haven't added a dropshadow, although I'm not sure I would really need one at all. 
</p>

<p><h3>8/10</h3><br>
My website is going well. I forgot to make the repository for it when I started, so it starts with hal;f he website already there. I feel like I'm doing quite well with the progress, I
 only have a few things left to do.<br>
I have been going through trying to make all my pages look as close to the figma files as I can. I feel like I'm beging quite extra with this thouhg. I really feel like I should be doing all
the pages I can, but I know I only have to make it look like a functioning website. <br><br>One thing I'm having problems with is that I started designing the website in desktop mode, so I had to change everything to make it
 responsive for mobile and tablet size screens. I had to go back and watch the repsonsive HTML video multiple times, and I learnt how to do media queries.
What they do is change the way something will react if the screen is below a certain size. I've used them to change around the grids when the screen gets to a 
tablet or phone size. <br><br>
I've done some cool little animation things with the image zoom when you hover on it, and im hoping to do a few more if I have time. I'm trying to keep the overall design of the website to very minimalistic,
 and easy to follow. I don't want to makie things too complicated for the viewer. </p>



 <p><h3>9/10</h3><br>
With tomorrow being hand in day I feel like I have done all I can for my website. I would have really loved to be able to add in some scrolling animations, and some fading in or out animations, but I didn't have a lot of time. <br>
I am really happy with how it did turn out. I liked the zoom in when you hover over the pictures, and I feel like I executed that aspect of interactive quite well.
I also really like the way I designed it, as it feels very minimalistic, and straight foward with the flow. The green feels calming, inviting, fresh, and healthy. All things that I would want to see on a website for learning to cook. I also chose that green specifically because 
it is cool toned, and that helps with being easy on the eyes, and it is easier for colourblind people to see. <br><br> I used this colourblind diagram to help chose a colour for the website.
<div class="pic"><img class="zoom" src="img/colourblind.png"></div>
With this diagram, I focused on the green. It isn't an exact colour match, but I had to try and fit it into somewhere. If we follow this green through, we can see that with the different types of colourblind vision, it is viewed as a tan kind of yellow and a blue. I figured that these
would be a good aesthetic as well. I would have preferred to use the purple, but I decided that it doesn't fit at all with what I'm trying to sell.</p>



<p><h3>14/10</h3>
With the trimester over, and almost all my projects handed I can focus my time on making this blog site look much better, and suit it more to how I want it. Currently it is quite plain and bland, so I'm going to attempt to beautify it and use javascript to make some cool animations, I also want
to make this feel professional and proper, as practice for when I make my portfolio.<br></p>



<h3>22/10</h3>
<p>I feel like I've now finished this blog website. I've added in the image zoom, and a scrolling fade in animation for each section. I've changed up the colours,
  and adjusted the structure of the layout. I'm quite happy with how this has turned out. I would have liked to have done a bit more, and structured it differently,
  but it would have taken a lot more time, and I don't have the time to redo the whole thing. I really enjoyed this whole blog website aspect, and I do
  wish I could have done more. <br><br>
  One thing I didn't enjoy is the fact that we had to do it up at the end. I think I work better when I have my design first, then I put in the content, and then
I can go back and adjust it again later.</p><p>wowwowo</p>
